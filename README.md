# DNA-Genetic-Distance-Analysis

This code issues an HTTP POST request to a URL from a group from FamilyTree DNA to download the group results.  It writes the downloaded results to a csv file and returns the DNA samples with the closest genetic distance to a given sample based on the Kit Number.  The focus is on the DNA matches at the 111 marker to provide the closest predictor possible of an ancestral relationship.
